### Description

Snake is a classic game. The player has to eat as much food as possible while the snake becomes larger and making the game harder. Avoid hitting the walls or
yourself, otherwise the game is over. As you progress, the snake speed will increase. The controlls are: W: Forward, A: Left, S: Down, D: right.

### Features

- Render modal for game over and new record
